# Phoenix Troubleshooting Guide
## Associations
### Nested Associations

**1. Problem:** When you submit a nested (create/update) form, nothing happens. The data isn't inserted, changesets aren't being invoked.

**Solution:** Check your params inside your controller. They should be of the form:
```elixir
%{ "model" => model_params}
```
It is very likely that you're passing `params` directly from your controller to your changeset. For example:

```elixir
# The wrong approach. Everything will be filtered out by your changeset 
# and you won't see any warnings in your logs.
def create(conn, params) do
    case update_city(params) do
    .
    .
    end
end
```

```elixir
# The right approach.
def create(conn, %{"city" => city_params}) do
    case update_city(city_params) do
    .
    .
    end
end
```

**2. Problem:** You get an error that says: ```invalid association :user. When using the :through option, the schema should not be passed as second argument```

**Solution:** This simply means that somewhere in your model, you're doing something like:
```elixir
has_one :user, Accounts.User, through: [:user_address, :user]
```
Instead, it should be:
```elixir
has_one :user, through: [:user_address, :user]
```

**3. Problem:** You get an error that says: ```Protocol Enumerable not implemented for MyApp.MyStruct
``` while using `form_for`.

**Solution:** This means that you're trying to generate a form with an ID attribute while your router doesn't hasn't defined any. Example, in your `router.ex`:
```elixir
get "/account/edit", UserController, :edit
```

But, whereas, inside your form.html.eex, you may be trying to do something like:
```elixir
<%= form_for user_path(@conn, :update, @current_user) %>
```
The problem is, your route doesn't have anywhere to capture the ID from the `@current_user`. So, it's actually expecting a route like this:
```elixir
get "/account/:id/edit", UserController, :edit
```
## Ecto
### Querying

**1. Problem:** You get an error that says: ```cannot use ^some_id outside of match clauses```

**Solution:**  This means you're trying to use Ecto's querying syntax such as `from x in SomeStruct` inside your module without importing Ecto.Query first. Include these lines:

```elixir
import Ecto.Query, warn: false
import Ecto.Changeset
```
## Changesets
### Forms

**1. Problem:** Your changeset errors aren't showing up.  ```form.errors is nil or []. Phoenix.HTML.Form does not take errors from changeset```
**Solution:** 
1. Inspect the form object (usually `f`). Check if `f.errors` has a non-empty array. If it is non-empty, it is very likely something to do with your error helpers. Check them in `views/error_helpers`. If the array is empty, then check the `form_for` tag. You may be passing a `@conn` object instead of `@changeset`.

## LiveView
**1. Problem:** Your application page keeps refreshing in production, but not on local. Your socket connections aren't working or are throwing errors.  ```Firefox canâ€™t establish a connection to the server at wss://example.com/live/websocket?_csrf_token=AW8fZ2IsfQE5BCMyHSBBAkEeXDA-RmIs5Zp3RyDOpkAxOyx75QoUm35A&_track_static%5B0%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcss%2Fapp-13404a0906796b323ae87ffa39743021.css%3Fvsn%3Dd&_track_static%5B1%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fjs%2Fapp-6483dc03ab95788286683ef9acb37e34.js%3Fvsn%3Dd&_mounts=0&vsn=2.0.0.```
**Solution:** 
This could happen due to many reasons. Here's the plan of attack:
1) Are you running a dockerized setup? If yes, run the docker container locally to see if sockets are able to connect locally. If not, then you will see the exact error that's causing this in the terminal.
2) Are you running on a serverless cloud environment like Google Cloud Run or AppEngine? These may have some limitations w.r.t websockets. Check their documentation. Check if a load balancer is blocking out connections, and disable it if so temporarily to debug.
3) Check your config files. Particularly, ensure `check_origin` has an array of allowed origins set correctly. Almost always, this is the cause.
